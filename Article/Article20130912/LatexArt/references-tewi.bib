abstract = { This paper tests two of the simplest and most popular trading rules--moving average and trading range break--by utilizing the Dow Jones Index from 1897 to 1986. Standard statistical analysis is extended through the use of bootstrap techniques. Overall, their results provide strong support for the technical strategies. The returns obtained from these strategies are not consistent with four popular null models: the random walk, the AR(1), the GARCH-M, and the Exponential GARCH. Buy signals consistently generate higher returns than sell signals, and further, the returns following buy signals are less volatile than returns following sell signals. Moreover, returns following sell signals are negative, which is not easily explained by any of the currently existing equilibrium models. Copyright 1992 by American Finance Association.},

An Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is successfully developed to forecast the long-term discharges in Manwan Hydropower. Using the long-term observations of discharges of monthly river flow discharges during 1953-2003, different types of membership functions and antecedent input flows associated with ANFIS model are tested. When compared to the ANN model, the ANFIS model has shown a significant forecast improvement. The training and validation results show that the ANFIS model is an effective algorithm to forecast the long-term discharges in Manwan Hydropower. The ANFIS model is finally employed in the advanced water resource project of Yunnan Power Group.},

@article{Friesen,
abstract = {While many technical trading rules are based upon patterns in asset prices, we lack convincing explanations of how and why these patterns arise, and why trading rules based on technical analysis are profitable. This paper provides a model that explains the success of certain trading rules that are based on patterns in past prices. We point to the importance of confirmation bias, which has been shown to play a key role in other types of decision making. Traders who acquire information and trade on the basis of that information tend to bias their interpretation of subsequent information in the direction of their original view. This produces autocorrelations and patterns of price movement that can predict future prices, such as the "head-and-shoulders" and "double-top" patterns. The model also predicts that sequential price jumps for a particular stock will be positively autocorrelated. We test this prediction and find that jumps exhibit statistically and economically significant positive autocorrelations.},

@misc{Wu2009,
abstract = {In this paper, the accuracy performance of monthly streamflow forecasts is discussed when using data-driven modeling techniques on the streamflow series. A crisp distributed support vectors regression (CDSVR) model was proposed for monthly streamflow prediction in comparison with four other models: autoregressive moving average (ARMA), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and crisp distributed artificial neural networks (CDANN). With respect to distributed models of CDSVR and CDANN, the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering technique first split the flow data into three subsets (low, medium, and high levels) according to the magnitudes of the data, and then three single SVRs (or ANNs) were fitted to three subsets. This paper gives a detailed analysis on reconstruction of dynamics that was used to identify the configuration of all models except for ARMA. To improve the model performance, the data-preprocessing techniques of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and/or moving average (MA) were coupled with all five models. Some discussions were presented (1) on the number of neighbors in KNN; (2) on the configuration of ANN; and (3) on the investigation of effects of MA and SSA. Two streamflow series from different locations in China (Xiangjiaba and Danjiangkou) were applied for the analysis of forecasting. Forecasts were conducted at four different horizons (1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month-ahead forecasts). The results showed that models fed by preprocessed data performed better than models fed by original data, and CDSVR outperformed other models except for at a 6-month-ahead horizon for Danjiangkou. For the perspective of streamflow series, the SSA exhibited better effects on Danjingkou data because its raw discharge series was more complex than the discharge of Xiangjiaba. The MA considerably improved the performance of ANN, CDANN, and CDSVR by adjusting the correlation relationship between input components and output of models. It was also found that the performance of CDSVR deteriorated with the increase of the forecast horizon.},
