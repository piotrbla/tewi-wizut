	abstract = {The definitive guide to technical analysis . . . written from a trader's perspectiveWith the keen insight and perspective that have made him a market legend, Jack D. Schwager explores, explains, and examines the application of technical analysis in futures trading. In the most in-depth, comprehensive book available, the bestselling investment writer demonstrates why he is one of today's foremost authorities. Here is the one volume no trader should be without."Jack Schwager has accomplished the rarest of feats in this book. He has presented material in a way that both the professional and layman can profit from. It is a must read for traders on all levels." - Stanley Druckenmillern Managing Director, Soros Fund Management"Jack Schwager's Technical Analysis is exactly what one should expect from this expert on futures. The book is comprehensive, thoroughly insightful, and highly educational. I recommend it to the beginner as well as the expert." - Leo Melamed Chairman, Sakura Dellsher, Inc."Jack Schwager possesses a remarkable ability to extract the important elements of complex, market-timing approaches, and distill that into something intelligible and useful. Not only is he able to present these ideas cleverly in an easily understood format, but he also demonstrates their application to the markets with clarity and precision." - Thomas R. DeMark Author, The New Science of Technical Analysis"Jack Schwager's book, A Complete Guide to the Futures Markets, was one of the best books I have read on futures trading. We give a copy of it to all our new analysts. Jack's latest work, Technical Analysis, looks like a gold mine of information, adding significantly to the existing investment literature." - Monroe Trout President, Trout Trading Management Co.Jack Schwager is one of the most important and visible figures in the futures industry today. His Market Wizards and The New Market Wizards are two of the bestselling finance titles of all time. Now, in the latest volume in the Schwager on Futures series, Technical Analysis, Schwager has created the most comprehensive guide ever for using technical analysis for futures trading. What makes Technical Analysis unique, besides its in-depth coverage, is that it is written from a trader's perspective. Schwager doesn't merely cover the subject, he explores what works and doesn't work in the real world of trading.Contains a comprehensive guide to chart analysis written with a particular focus on trading applications* Includes a separate 200+ page section illustrating the use of chart analysis in the real world* Details and illustrates several original trading systems* Includes a self-contained primer on cyclical analysis* Describes popular oscillators, the pitfalls in their common use, and guidelines to their successful application in trading* Explains the concept and use of "continuous futures" and compares 10-year continuous futures charts with conventional nearest futures charts for all major U.S. futures markets* Contains a section on trading strategy and philosophy, including over 100 trading tipsHundreds of charts, tables, and examples illustrate key points throughout, while the text is written in the informative, insightful, and nontechnical style that has made Jack Schwager one of the most highly regarded and bestselling investment authors ever. This invaluable book by one of the world's foremost authorities is destined to become the premier industry guide on technical analysis for many years to come.},

@book{Leshik2011,
	abstract = {Interest in algorithmic trading is growing massively – it’s cheaper, faster and better to control than standard trading, it enables you to ‘pre-think’ the market, executing complex math in real time and take the required decisions based on the strategy defined. We are no longer limited by human ‘bandwidth’. The cost alone (estimated at 6 cents per share manual, 1 cent per share algorithmic) is a sufficient driver to power the growth of the industry. According to consultant firm, Aite Group LLC, high frequency trading firms alone account for 73\% of all US equity trading volume, despite only representing approximately 2\% of the total firms operating in the US markets. Algorithmic trading is becoming the industry lifeblood. But it is a secretive industry with few willing to share the secrets of their success.The book begins with a step-by-step guide to algorithmic trading, demystifying this complex subject and providing readers with a specific and usable algorithmic trading knowledge. It provides background information leading to more advanced work by outlining the current trading algorithms, the basics of their design, what they are, how they work, how they are used, their strengths, their weaknesses, where we are now and where we are going.The book then goes on to demonstrate a selection of detailed algorithms including their implementation in the markets. Using actual algorithms that have been used in live trading readers have access to real time trading functionality and can use the never before seen algorithms to trade their own accounts.The markets are complex adaptive systems exhibiting unpredictable behaviour. As the markets evolve algorithmic designers need to be constantly aware of any changes that may impact their work, so for the more adventurous reader there is also a section on how to design trading algorithms.All examples and algorithms are demonstrated in Excel on the accompanying CD ROM, including actual algorithmic examples which have been used in live trading.},

    abstract = {{
                We provide a unified overview of methods that currently are widely used to assess the accuracy of prediction algorithms, from raw percentages, quadratic error measures and other distances, and correlation coefficients, and to information theoretic measures such as relative entropy and mutual information. We briefly discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. For classification tasks, we derive new learning algorithms for the design of prediction systems by directly optimising the correlation coefficient. We observe and prove several results relating sensitivity and specificity of optimal systems. While the principles are general, we illustrate the applicability on specific problems such as protein secondary structure and signal peptide prediction.
